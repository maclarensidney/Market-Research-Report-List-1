<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vapour Recovery Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-type Recovery</li><li>Closed-type Recovery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vapor Recovery Units (VRUs) market is segmented into open-type and closed-type recovery systems. Open-type recovery involves capturing vapors emitted during the loading or unloading of liquids, allowing for some escape into the atmosphere. This method is often easier to implement but less efficient. In contrast, closed-type recovery systems efficiently capture and condense vapors, preventing atmospheric release, thus offering better environmental compliance and safety. This difference significantly influences adoption rates across various industrial sectors, particularly in oil and gas.</p></p>
