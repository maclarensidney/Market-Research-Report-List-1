<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ischemic Stroke Diagnostic Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thrombotic</li><li>Embolic</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ischemic stroke diagnostic equipment market includes various types of strokes: thrombotic, embolic, and others. Thrombotic strokes occur when a blood clot forms in an artery supplying blood to the brain, often related to atherosclerosis. Embolic strokes result from a clot or debris forming elsewhere in the body and traveling to the brain. The “others” category encompasses atypical or less common stroke causes. Diagnostic equipment such as CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds are used to identify these stroke types effectively.</p></p>
