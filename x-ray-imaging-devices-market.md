<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-ray Imaging Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DR</li><li>CR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>X-ray imaging devices are categorized mainly into two types: Digital Radiography (DR) and Computed Radiography (CR). DR uses digital detectors to capture images directly, allowing for immediate display and processing, which enhances image quality and reduces exposure time. In contrast, CR employs traditional X-ray films that are later scanned with a laser to convert them into digital format. While CR is generally more cost-effective, DR is favored for its efficiency and superior image clarity, driving market demand in healthcare settings.</p></p>
