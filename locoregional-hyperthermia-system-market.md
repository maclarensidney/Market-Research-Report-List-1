<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Locoregional Hyperthermia System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Heat Delivery System</li><li>Internal Heat Delivery System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The locoregional hyperthermia system market comprises two primary types: external and internal heat delivery systems. External heat delivery systems utilize devices placed outside the body, such as radiofrequency or microwave generators, to heat specific areas, often targeting tumors. Internal heat delivery systems involve the introduction of heat through minimally invasive techniques, like catheter-based devices or implants, delivering thermal energy directly to the affected tissues. Both methods aim to enhance cancer treatment efficacy by increasing the temperature in targeted regions, aiding in tumor reduction.</p></p>
